<summary>Until Now</summary><br/>

  
Tata Sky partnered with EY for their expertise in processes automation. EY helped Tata Sky select [Automation Anywhere RPA](https://www.automationanywhere.com/rpa/robotic-process-automation) and helped them determine which processes would be the best to automate, providing the greatest return on investment. Tata Sky began automating processes within its [finance](https://www.automationanywhere.com/solutions/finance-accounting), supply chain, and treasury departments before moving to more complex processes within its taxation and tax-related reconciliation teams.<br/>
  
In early 2021 Tata Sky and Croma, the entities owned by Tata Group, exposed the data of millions of their customers due to security vulnerabilities, according to a cybersecurity researcher. The issues allowed bad actors to access sensitive data including the full names, phone numbers, addresses, date of birth, and email IDs of both Tata Sky and Croma customers, by leveraging the loopholes existing in the application programme interfaces (APIs) on their websites. Both companies fixed the vulnerabilities after these were reported on the Web.
