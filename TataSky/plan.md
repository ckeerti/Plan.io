Tata Sky chose IBMs WebSphere SOA, which has the capability of migrating the
existing applications into services, to create a computing architecture meant to
easily manage the growth of business apart from meeting customers requirements.
The solution suite was keeping with the emerging needs of the future. <br/>Tata Sky
managed to model its business process with the help of IBM WebSphere Business
Modeler. This also ensured that these processes were deployed, monitored and
initiated to meet key performance indicators. The other component of the
solution suite was IBM WebSphere Process Server (IBM WPS), a type of performance
engine. The IBM WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus helped connect various
applications of Tata. <br/>Finally it was the IBM WebSphere Portal, which helped
create a rich user experience and the IBM Tivoli Composite Application Manager
for ensuring applications performance and availability. Self-service portals also took the load off customer
care as customers started troubleshooting themselves
